# What You Need to Know About Open Source Licenses

## Public Domain

Public domain equivalent license are licenses that grant public-domain-like rights or/and act as waivers. They are used to make copyrighted works usable by anyone without conditions, while avoiding the complexities of attribution or license compatibility that occur with other licenses. However in different countries **Public Domain** concept can be undefined or defined in different ways, so usage of this license can bring some risks.

### Zero / public domain (CC0)

[CC0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license#Zero_.2F_public_domain)  was created for compatibility with law domains which have no concept of dedicating into public domain. This is achieved by a public domain waiver statement and a fall-back to all-permissive license.

## Permissive software license

A permissive software license, sometimes also called BSD-like or BSD-style license, is a free software licence with minimal requirements about how the software can be redistributed. Such licenses requiring little more than attributing the original portions of the licensed code to the original developers in your own code and/or documentation.

Examples: [MIT Licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), [BSD licences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses), [Apple Public Source License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Public_Source_License) and the [Apache licence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License).

## Copyleft software license

Copyleft is a general method for making a program (or other work) free (in the sense of freedom, not “zero price”), and requiring all modified and extended versions of the program to be free as well. 

Copyleft licenses for software require that information necessary for reproducing and modifying the work must be made available to recipients of the binaries

What does it mean in practice? 

* If you use copyleft software in your internal application and don't distribute it you have no obligation to do anything.
